## Recommendation Systems

<i>In this project, I explore the the movie lens data set, which contains over 10,000 movie reviews in 1998. I use the Apache Spark to pull the data I need, construct data schemas, and build an Alternating Least Squares recommendation model. This specific model makes a broader recommendation based on age, but can easily be tweaked to recommend based on other user specific demographics or based on other users who share similar ratings. </i>
